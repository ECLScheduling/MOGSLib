/**
 * TODO: The following flags are a remedy for the problem of setting the adaptor and strategy.
 * As it is currently implemented, there are still changes to be made in this file and possibly inside OpenMP before full support. 
 * A possible and elegant way to proper configure this file's include and pre-processor directives is to work on the pre-processing script,
 * currently configure.sh, to better address the problem of selecting the strategy, the target system and which information to use from within.
 * For now this is cumbersome but can already be used as a proof of concept that portability is do-able, yet not simple.
